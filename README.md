# Basic ALU Design Using Verilog

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project implements a *Basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)* using Verilog HDL. The ALU supports a small set of essential arithmetic and logical operations such as *addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT. Along with the Verilog module, this repository includes a **comprehensive testbench* and simulation setup that demonstrates the ALU's functionality using example input cases.

The project is targeted at students and learners exploring digital design, computer architecture, or FPGA development and aims to serve as a foundation for understanding how ALUs work in modern processors.


## ðŸ”§ Features

- 4-bit inputs for operands A and B
- 3-bit operation selector input (op)
- 4-bit output result
- Supported operations:
  - 000: Addition (A + B)
  - 001: Subtraction (A - B)
  - 010: Bitwise AND (A & B)
  - 011: Bitwise OR (A | B)
  - 100: Bitwise NOT (~A)
- Synchronous testbench simulation
